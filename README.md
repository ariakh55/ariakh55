Hey it's me Aria.

I am also known as **Mastergrill** on Twitter (not Elon's ex). Doing all sorts of dirty stuff (Web app development /w sprinkle of AI) to make money.
However the real deal is my passion for finding out about stuff like game engines, systems programming, and lots of other stuff.

I worked on some project (mostly unfinished) which can be seen in either pinned section of my github profile or [here](https://sulfursashimi.tech/projects)
Not much of works or side projects but it was honest at the very least (or was out of boredom)
