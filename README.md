As you can see this is me and my works<br>It might look a bit messy cause if I could focus I would be dentist<br>Jokes aside, I'm a neovim + tmux nerd (dotfiles are pinned) and love to tweak my gnu/linux environment.<br><br> Currently I'm working on some AI chat bot using custom content.<br>Also I have other projects that I'm working on (never going to be finished side-projects).<br>Iâ€™m currently low level programming (I want to do more engineering than development)<br> Ask me about how I got into CLI stuff<br>Fun fact is that I know how to speak C1 German and still not good at it
